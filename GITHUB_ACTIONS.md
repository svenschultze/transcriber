# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

This repository includes several GitHub Actions workflows for building and releasing the Transcriber application across Windows and macOS platforms.

## Workflows

### 1. `ci.yml` - Full Release Build (Signed)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/master, PRs, manual dispatch
- **Platforms**: Windows and macOS  
- **Features**:
  - Code signing support (requires secrets)
  - Creates MSI/NSIS installers for Windows
  - Creates DMG packages for macOS
  - Automatic releases on main branch

### 2. `build-unsigned.yml` - Simple Build (Unsigned)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/master/develop, PRs, manual dispatch
- **Platforms**: Windows and macOS
- **Features**:
  - Builds unsigned executables
  - No code signing required
  - Quick builds for testing

### 3. `build-deno.yml` - Deno-Optimized Build
- **Triggers**: Push to main/master/develop, PRs, manual dispatch
- **Platforms**: Windows and macOS
- **Features**:
  - TypeScript checking with Deno
  - Linting and formatting checks
  - Deno task runner integration

## Required Secrets (for signed builds)

To enable code signing and release builds, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

### For Windows Code Signing:
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Windows code signing certificate (base64 encoded)
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`: Password for the signing certificate

### For macOS Code Signing:
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`: Your Apple Developer certificate (base64 encoded)
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: Password for the certificate
- `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`: Your Apple signing identity
- `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple ID email
- `APPLE_PASSWORD`: App-specific password for your Apple ID
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Your Apple Developer Team ID

## Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add each required secret with its corresponding value

## Deno Integration

The project is configured to work with both npm and Deno:

- `deno.json` contains task definitions and compiler options
- Use `deno task build` instead of `npm run build` when using Deno
- Deno handles TypeScript checking, linting, and formatting

## Usage

### Running Builds Locally

```bash
# Using npm
npm install
npm run build
npm run tauri build

# Using Deno
deno task build
deno task tauri:build
```

### Triggering Builds

- **Automatic**: Push commits to main/master/develop branches
- **Manual**: Use the "Actions" tab in GitHub and click "Run workflow"
- **Pull Requests**: Builds automatically run for all PRs

## Artifacts

Built applications are uploaded as artifacts and can be downloaded from the Actions tab:

- **Windows**: `.msi` and `.exe` installers
- **macOS**: `.dmg` packages and `.app` bundles

## Notes

- The unsigned build workflow is recommended for development and testing
- Signed builds require proper certificates and are recommended for production releases
- Deno workflows include additional TypeScript validation and code quality checks
- All workflows cache dependencies to improve build times
